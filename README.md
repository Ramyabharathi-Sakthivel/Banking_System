PROJECT OVERVIEW :

The Banking System is a Java-based application developed to simulate core banking operations such as account management, balance enquiry, and fund transfers.
The system follows a layered architecture (Bean, DAO, Service) and interacts with a relational database to store and retrieve account and transaction details.
It is designed to demonstrate real-world banking logic, database connectivity using JDBC, and structured object-oriented programming practices.

FEATURES :

--> Account validation and management
--> Balance enquiry
--> Money transfer between accounts
--> Transaction ID generation using database sequence
--> Update and maintain account balances
--> Store transfer/transaction history
--> Custom exception handling for insufficient funds
--> Layered architecture (DAO–Service–Bean structure)

TECHNOLOGIES USED :

Java – Core programming language
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) – Database interaction
Oracle / SQL Database – Data storage for accounts and transactions
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Encapsulation, Abstraction, Modular design
Exception Handling – Custom exceptions for validation and fund checks
JDK (Java Development Kit) – Compilation and execution environment
IDE Tools – Eclipse
